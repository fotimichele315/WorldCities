# WorldCities
<<<<<<< HEAD
WorldCities – A personal demo project that displays an extensive catalog of global cities, with position (latitude/longitude) and population data.. The project is based on the examples from the book ASP.NET Core 8 and Angular by Valerio De Sanctis, but with several modifications and updates. I adapted and improved the original code, updating the technologies to the latest stable versions available at the time of development, to better reflect modern best practices in full-stack web development with ASP.NET Core and Angular.
